# LogicNow Technical Exercise - ChessProject

Welcome to the technical exercise used to assess candidates for Developer roles at LogicNow

You can carry out this exercise in your own time, in your IDE of choice.

This project will give you a chance to demonstrate your skills in a variety of different methodologies.
Some of the things we think are important:
* Clean Code
* Unit Tests (We use TDD at LogicNow)
* Design patterns
* Refactoring


__STEPS__  
1. Fork your own copy of this Repo by either:   
    * Public - Fork a copy into your own public github account   
    * Private - Fork a copy onto your local machine (Download the repo), or private Repo if you have one.   
2. Choose which language you are most comfortable completing this in - you have a choice of PHP, Java, C#  
3. Read the documentation for the project and follow the instructions  
4. Commit updated code to your repo for the project (please maintain an offline repo if doing this privately)  
5. Once complete  
    * Public - Email link to your repo to [grant.meldrum@logicnow.com](mailto:grant.meldrum@logicnow.com?subject=Developer ChessProject Completed)  
    * Private - zip up your repo (or upload to your Cloud Storage service of choice) and submit at the link given in the initial email, or email to [grant.meldrum@solarwinds.com](mailto:grant.meldrum@solarwinds.com?subject=Developer ChessProject Completed)


Timescales - as a rough guide please aim to get this back to us within 1 week of starting the project, but we do understand that life gets in the way sometimes!
